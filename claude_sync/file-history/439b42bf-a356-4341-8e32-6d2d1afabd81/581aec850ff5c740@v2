# Innovation Workspace

This workspace has the `/innovate` slash command activated.

## Usage

### In Claude Code:

```
/innovate
```

This will activate all 8 innovation frameworks:
1. Socratic Challenge
2. Perspective Multiplication
3. Inversion Principle
4. Cross-Domain Pollination
5. Iterative Deepening
6. Constraint-Based Innovation
7. Stupid Questions Protocol
8. Future Backward Thinking

## Setup for Any Project

To add `/innovate` to any of your projects:

```bash
# In your project directory
mkdir -p .claude/commands
cp /tmp/innovation-workspace/.claude/commands/innovate.md .claude/commands/
```

## Quick Test

Try it now:
1. Ask me any question
2. Type `/innovate` first
3. I'll apply all frameworks to your question

## Examples

```
/innovate

I believe momentum trading works well in crypto markets.
```

I'll then challenge assumptions, show multiple perspectives, identify failure modes, and dig deeper.
