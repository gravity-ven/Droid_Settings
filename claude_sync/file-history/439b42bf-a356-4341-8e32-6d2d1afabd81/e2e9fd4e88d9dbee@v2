# `/innovate` Slash Command - Quick Start

## What You Now Have

✅ A working `/innovate` slash command
✅ Activates all 8 innovation frameworks instantly
✅ Works in any Claude Code session

## Immediate Usage (Right Now)

Since you're already in Claude Code, the `/innovate` command is available in this workspace:

```
/innovate
```

**Then ask your question**. I'll apply all frameworks automatically.

## Test It Right Now

Try this:

```
/innovate

I want to build a trading system using machine learning to predict price movements.
```

I'll respond with:
- Socratic challenges to your assumptions
- 5 different expert perspectives
- Failure modes to avoid
- Cross-domain insights
- Deep analysis
- Novel approaches

## Setup for Your Projects

### Option 1: Add to Specific Project (30 seconds)

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd ~/your-trading-project

# Create commands directory
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Copy the command
cp /tmp/innovation-workspace/.claude/commands/innovate.md .claude/commands/

# Done! Now /innovate works in that project
```

### Option 2: Add to All Future Projects (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /tmp/innovation-workspace
./install-innovate-globally.sh
```

This adds `/innovate` to your git template, so every new repository gets it automatically.

### Option 3: Add to All Existing Projects (One-liner)

Run this from any project root:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands && cp /tmp/innovation-workspace/.claude/commands/innovate.md .claude/commands/
```

## How It Works

When you type `/innovate`, the content of `.claude/commands/innovate.md` is inserted into the conversation as a system prompt.

This tells me to:
1. Challenge all assumptions (Socratic Method)
2. Show multiple perspectives
3. Identify failure modes (Inversion)
4. Import ideas from other fields
5. Dig deeper than surface level
6. Apply constraints for creativity
7. Ask "stupid questions"
8. Work backward from goals

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Strategy Analysis

```
/innovate

Analyze this trading strategy: [your strategy]
```

### Pattern 2: Research Direction

```
/innovate

I want to research [topic]. What should I explore?
```

### Pattern 3: Problem Solving

```
/innovate

I'm stuck on [problem]. Help me think through it.
```

### Pattern 4: Code Review

```
/innovate

Review this code: [paste code]
Look for assumptions, failure modes, and novel improvements.
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Use Early**: Type `/innovate` at the start of complex questions
2. **Combine**: Use with other commands like `/innovate` then describe your coding task
3. **Iterate**: After my response, ask "dig deeper" to apply frameworks recursively
4. **Customize**: Edit `.claude/commands/innovate.md` to add your own frameworks

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Without `/innovate`:
```
User: Should I use RSI for trading signals?
Claude: Yes, RSI is a popular indicator that measures overbought/oversold conditions...
```

### With `/innovate`:
```
User: /innovate

Should I use RSI for trading signals?

Claude: Let me challenge this from multiple angles:

SOCRATIC CHALLENGE:
- What assumption makes you think RSI would work?
- What if RSI is popular precisely because it doesn't work (survivorship bias)?
- Have you actually tested it, or is this based on what you've read?

PERSPECTIVE MULTIPLICATION:
- Skeptical Quant: "Show me the p-value. Every backtest I've seen shows RSI fails out-of-sample"
- Experienced Trader: "RSI works, but only when combined with price action and volume"
- Psychologist: "Are you looking for RSI to give you permission to trade?"
- Risk Manager: "RSI will fail catastrophically during regime changes"
- Novice: "If RSI worked, why isn't everyone rich?"

INVERSION (Failure Modes):
1. RSI divergences that never resolve
2. Overbought markets that stay overbought for months
3. Whipsaws in ranging markets
4. Parameter sensitivity (why 14 periods?)

CROSS-DOMAIN:
- Physics: Oscillators have natural frequency and damping - markets don't
- Biology: Homeostasis ≠ mean reversion in prices
- Information Theory: RSI compresses price data, losing information

[... continues with 4 more frameworks ...]

SYNTHESIS:
Instead of asking "should I use RSI?", ask:
- What specific market condition am I trying to detect?
- What would be a direct measure of that condition?
- How can I test if RSI actually detects it?

Novel approach: Test RSI inverted - sell oversold, buy overbought (trend-following)
```

## The Difference

**Without frameworks**: Surface-level, conventional thinking
**With frameworks**: Deep, novel, multi-perspective insights

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test it now** in this workspace
2. **Install globally** using the script
3. **Use daily** for all complex decisions
4. **Customize** by editing the command file
5. **Internalize** - after a month, you'll think this way naturally

## File Locations

- **This workspace**: `/tmp/innovation-workspace/`
- **Command file**: `.claude/commands/innovate.md`
- **Install script**: `./install-innovate-globally.sh`

## Ready to Test?

Try it right now. Type:

```
/innovate

[Your question or problem]
```

And watch the innovation frameworks come alive.
