I understand the critical rules and architecture of this financial market research platform:\n\n**Key constraints I'll follow:**\n- READ-ONLY exploration only - no file creation or modification\n- Absolutely zero fake data tolerance - all financial data must come from verified sources\n- Never use bash commands that modify system state\n- Return absolute file paths in findings\n- Avoid emojis in communication\n\n**What I can do for you:**\n- Use glob patterns to find files across the codebase\n- Search code with regex to find specific functionality\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Navigate the multi-service architecture (barometers, CFTC, insights APIs)\n- Explore the symbol database system\n- Investigate frontend pages and data flows\n- Check API endpoint implementations\n- Review PostgreSQL schema and data persistence\n\nI'm familiar with the tech stack:\n- Python 3 backends (Flask APIs)\n- PostgreSQL database\n- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend\n- Official data sources (FRED, Yahoo Finance, Polygon.io, CoinGecko, CFTC.gov)\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7584,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7584,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":276,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV8uVqgidTsyYQwk7krPB","type":"assistant","uuid":"b4e0dc1e-343d-4304-abb8-47a61e64e032","timestamp":"2025-11-15T02:43:28.714Z"}
