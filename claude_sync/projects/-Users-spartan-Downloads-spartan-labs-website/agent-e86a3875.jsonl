Only verified sources (FRED, Yahoo Finance, CoinGecko, Polygon.io, etc.)\n\n2. **DIAMOND RULE - Fix Before User Knows**: All issues must be caught autonomously. The system uses `BULLETPROOF_STARTUP.py` to ensure 100% readiness before user interaction.\n\n3. **ARCHITECTURE MANTRA - Single Entry Point**: All services converge through `BULLETPROOF_STARTUP.py` on macOS (legacy Windows `.bat` files exist but are adapted).\n\nKey technical details I'll follow:\n- PostgreSQL only (no SQLite) - `spartan_website_db`\n- Multi-service architecture on ports 5001, 5002, 5003, 5004, 8082, 9000, 9001\n- Single global symbol database: `symbols_database.json` (13,000+ instruments)\n- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)\n- All data from verified sources only\n\nI'm currently in `/Users/spartan/Downloads/spartan_labs/website` and ready to search, read, and analyze code.\n\nWhat would you like me to explore?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":7584,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":7584,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":325,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV8vxdvAY2SLzi4X5VYmy","type":"assistant","uuid":"8bb3e09f-5ebb-43c4-b5f5-6addaa0fa8ea","timestamp":"2025-11-15T03:02:40.109Z"}
