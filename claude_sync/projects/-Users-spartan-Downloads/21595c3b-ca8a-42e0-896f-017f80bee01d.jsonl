The `fetch_fred_data` function is using date ranges that are too restrictive. When `days_back=30` or `days_back=60`, but the latest economic data (like CPI) was from September 2025 and we're now in November 2025, that's about 45+ days ago. So the API won't find it.\n\nI need to significantly increase the `days_back` parameters throughout the code or remove the date restriction entirely and just use `sort_order=desc` with a limit.\n\nLet me update the API to use much longer lookback periods.","signature":"EqMFCkYICRgCKkCJ+yk2+cqmMBRcr7KH3iO6O0wJpB3XHMY2jJ+ue6BEIpANFvIgMH/wgkFOI528kFFtll06Yi4+qsUpdfHYMPF0Egx8Lz/qguX0AN+Xu+saDAV8m66H21YaQHOWTSIw9DyBoc3PpKb88hR6fuU4VcP+yyDgCIOW5vguV+lLr4ZUrVd9IcxxeZ8V1KUNUye8KooETz7qqoo7ATaB1iIIRCo3Bly39rTXMLW6+YbSxChlUtG8Eb6nNsCyn1WQVnyeT2NxP7Y47bNjoEBSuh0Eg0ToMgxUhSrtQkqWAHVY+BqFpqtxf2BNVZNnp8xYHY6ONpz+quGD4DSIPuaU4x4tzEv2tRRfK1wkDgTnijPdF4z6TONiki4ewCtuRCFWAx1rQ4/6L7/ZaEHgEv0veK1LKz11mc/LdQx/agqzpQw8ksQU+4R9bZMpsGRS+suNTIWfIWWieuXKjwZg5dCidWajkK2pTNr/OBlIxyTgAR8GFLbALNllbldViq2zXPzDlVt8Io0OGaldK0kpQnxy06tlGyEx2mslLcIURWWwNPQr3bcflwNpk4krT0GJzivuVdQT9Vf4KSO++F7rdJzhrr5xv+VXNWHzLd4rgvJi75As2tGN3Ll8Qr6m7iGjEmG9pWcWVbohk7Y0ObJ6ztbxESuH6DLmPhjHlQCFscHNqNczzhrrchQyv+3nngNgDM+KB6hakHEWvR9QKiazKd7wGkRnyfq1Q8PEQ6duaEjRaRFuFqWRoNp94/fJNZsKMOsn9iI8V47MSlZk8VsxeaulbGfTrZjMj67LqTGN7jkufTAER/UmbxH8l5kS2ouCoIIAkWDrmQba4d5YwGPSkmujx+MwmXGx/vZJs0rHEPzccnCKYCoqOEZNFb2jsazOzIrkGAE="}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1383,"cache_read_input_tokens":89990,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1383,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1153,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CV7iejmz36MDgSfL3EU5d","type":"assistant","uuid":"cf14ee5d-4d4a-4f51-ac22-533852aa8e96","timestamp":"2025-11-14T11:40:40.513Z"}
